# Phantis

***PHANTIS** is an incredible 100% video arcade adventure. Face 24 different enemies throughout 4 zones and 6 different levels. Phantis incorporates **DOUBLE LOAD FX**, two programs in one. Double the graphics, double the adventure and maximum addictiveness.*

## Phantis

Commander Serena's mission is to rescue her expedition partner from Moon IV of the **SOTPOK** System, better known as the world of **PHANTIS**, an unusual place inhabited by hostile fauna and exuberant flora.

## Double Load FX

This program has two parts, each part recorded on one side of the tape. To play the second part, it is necessary to discover the access code found at the end of the first one.

## Phase One:

Consisting of 4 zones, your objective is to land on the planet and cross the swamp on the back of your **ADREC CLONE**.

- **First:** As you approach Moon IV, you will be attacked by the Kamikaze hordes of **SENOLIZ**.
- **Second:** You will fly over the volcanic area. Avoid recon fighters, glowing magma balls, and autonomous reconnaissance surface-to-air missiles.
- **Third:** You will enter the underground cave that connects with the swamp and be attacked by **MULTIPLIER SNAKES** that emit nebulous Krypton and the enemy ships that patrol the grotto.
- **Fourth:** Once you land you can capture an **ADREC** clone that will allow you to cross the swamp. You will have a photonic blade to help you defeat the inhabitants of the swamp who fight mounted on giant toads and pterodactyls.

## Phase Two:

You must descend the deepest parts of **PHANTIS** and go through 6 different levels until you find and rescue your partner from **PRISON**.

1. **Surface:** Mountainous area inhabited by *Space Balls*. Use a rebellious Spaceball to kill them.
2. **Alien Base:** Find the Turbo Ionic Laser and its Proton Charger to arm yourself with full power.
3. **Underground Forest:** You must get a Security Badge in order to go through the Blue Door.
4. **Inland Lake:** Escape from the ferocious jaws of the Plentosaur that lives in the thermal waters of the lake, and also take care of the murderous piranas, until you reach the heliport.
5. **Magma Caves:** The helicopter will fly across the grotto that leads to the volcanic area. Avoid lava bubbles and molten rock slides.
6. **The Prison:** Destroy the red devils that guard the ancient prison so that you and your partner can escape from **PHANTIS**.

##### GOOD LUCK!

## Score
There are 24 different enemies in **PHANTIS**. Eliminating them will give you points. In the first phase you have 4 lives with an extra life given every 25,000 points. In the second phase you start with 5 lives and can find hearts to get more.
